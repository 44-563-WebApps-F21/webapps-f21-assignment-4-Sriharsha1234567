    <h5>_Sitting-room at Mrs. Arbuthnot’s_.  _Large open French window at back_,

     <h5 class = "name LADYHUNSTANTON">LADY HUNSTANTON</h5> 
     <p class = "speech">Good morning, Gerald.</p>
     <br>

<h5 class ="name GERALD">GERALD</h6>  
<p class= "stage-direction" >[_Rising_.]</p>  
<p class = "speech">Good morning, Lady Hunstanton.</p> 

<h5 class= "name LADYHUNSTANTON">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h5>  
<p class= "stage-direction">[_Sitting down_.]</p>  
<p class= "speech">We came to inquire for your dear
mother, Gerald.  I hope she is better?</p><br>

<h5 class = "name GERALD">GERALD</h5>
<p class= "speech">My mother has not come down yet, Lady Hunstanton.</p><br>

<h5 class= "name LADYHUNSTANTON">LADY HUNSTANTON</h5>
<p class =  "speech">Ah, I am afraid the heat was too much for her last
night.  I think there must have been thunder in the air.  Or perhaps it
was the music.  Music makes one feel so romantic—at least it always gets
on one’s nerves.</p><br>

<h5 class= " name MRSALLONBY">MRS.ALLONBY</h5>  
<p class = "speech">It’s the same thing, nowadays.</p><br>

<h5 class = "name LADYHUNSTANTON">LADY HUNSTANTON</h5>  
<p class = "speech">I am so glad I don’t know what you mean, dear. I am
afraid you mean something wrong.  Ah, I see you’re examining Mrs.
Arbuthnot’s pretty room.  Isn’t it nice and old-fashioned?</p><br>

<h5 class= "name MRS.ALLONBY">MRS. ALLONBY</h5>  
<p class ="stage-direction">[_Surveying the room through her lorgnette_.]</p>  
<p class ="speech">It looks
quite the happy English home.</p><br>

<h5 class = "name LADYHUNSTANTON">LADY HUNSTANTON</h5>  
<p class= "speech">That’s just the word, dear; that just describes it.
One feels your mother’s good influence in everything she has about her,
Gerald.</p><br>

<h5 class = "name MRSALLONBY">MRS. ALLONBY</h5>  
<p class = "speech">Lord Illingworth says that all influence is bad, but that
a good influence is the worst in the world.</p><br>

<h5 class = "name LADYHUNSTANTON">LADY HUNSTANTON</h5>  
<p class = "speech">It would do him a great deal of good, dear.  Most women
in London, nowadays, seem to furnish their rooms with nothing but
orchids, foreigners, and French novels.  But here we have the room of a
sweet saint.  Fresh natural flowers, books that don’t shock one, pictures
that one can look at without blushing.</p><br>

<h5 class ="name LADYHUNSTANTON">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h5>  
<p class ="speech">She is quite incorrigible, Gerald, isn’t she?
By-the-by, Gerald, I hope your dear mother will come and see me more
often now.  You and Lord Illingworth start almost immediately, don’t you?</p><br>
