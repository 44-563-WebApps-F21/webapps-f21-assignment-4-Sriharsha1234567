    <p class = "speech">Mrs. Arbuthnot’s compliments, my lady, but she has a bad
headache, and cannot see any one this morning.</p>

<p> A bad headache!  I am so sorry!  Perhaps
you’ll bring her up to Hunstanton this afternoon, if she is better,
Gerald.</p>

<h5 class = "name GERALD">GERALD</h5>  
<p>I am afraid not this afternoon, Lady Hunstanton.</p>

<p class ="speech">Well, to-morrow, then.  Ah, if you had a father,
Gerald, he wouldn’t let you waste your life here.  He would send you off
with Lord Illingworth at once.  But mothers are so weak.  They give up to
their sons in everything.  We are all heart, all heart.  Come, dear, I
must call at the rectory and inquire for Mrs. Daubeny, who, I am afraid,
is far from well.  It is wonderful how the Archdeacon bears up, quite
wonderful.  He is the most sympathetic of husbands.  Quite a model.
Good-bye, Gerald, give my fondest love to your mother.</p>
